# BuzZ

BuzZ is a extensible and configurable library for network data collect from social medias with realtime (stream) suport. This works based on two interfaces: buzz and buzzData.


### buzz Interface
Implements the connection with the network and how the library will communicate with social medias (eg.: twitter, facebook, instagram, etc.)


### buzzData Interface
Implements the way that data will be stored (eg.: postgresql, file, stdout, etc.).
